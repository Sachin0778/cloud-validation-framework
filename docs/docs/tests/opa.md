# Open Policy Agent (OPA) Integration

Prancer Cloud Validation framework has built-in simple and robust classic rule engine to write test rules to validate the cloud resources. However with the industry adopting a standard method of writing policy rules and their evaluation, Prancer has integrated OPA (Open Policy Agent) and its rule language (REGO) support to write and evaluate policy rules. By leveraging OPA in Prancer framework, it gives us the capability to write complex rules to evaluate cloud resources.

### Requirements for OPA
  - OPA has been integrated as a binary executable. This executable has to be downloaded and installed with an execute permission.
  - Update prancer config.ini with a separate section as:

```
  [OPA]
  opa=true
  opaexe=<Path to the OPA binary>
```

  - OPA rules can be written embedded in a test case or as a separate rego file. The examples of a classic rule and rego embedded rule in the framework are as:

```
{ 
    "testId": "2",
    "rule":"{TEST_RESOURCE_JSON_ID}.SecurityGroups[0].GroupName='launch-wizard-1'"
},
{
    "testId": "3",
    "type": "rego",
    "rule": "input.SecurityGroups[0].GroupName=\"launch-wizard-1\"",
    "snapshotId": ["TEST_RESOURCE_JSON_ID"],
    "eval": "data.rule.rulepass"
}
```

   The classic rule has an expression with a Left Hand Side(LHS) and Right Hand Side(RHS) with a comparator operator. The classic rule engine evaluates LHS and RHS, uses the comparator to evaluate the rule.

   The Rego rule has an evaluation for a policy and the default has been set to "data.rule.rulepass" and this is evaluated for true value for a test to pass. The rule type has to be specified as "rego" for backward compatability of the framework.

   - *OPA* rules can also be written in a separate rego file. The examples of a classic rule and rego rule written in a separate file in the framework are as:

```
{
    "testId": "1",
    "rule":"exist({TEST_RESOURCE_JSON_ID}.SecurityGroups)"
},
{
    "testId": "4",
    "type": "rego",
    "rule": "file(ruleexists.rego)",
    "snapshotId": ["TEST_RESOURCE_JSON_ID"],
    "eval": "data.rule.rulepass"
}
```

And here is the `ruleexists.rego`:
```
package rule
default rulepass = true
rulepass = false{
    is_null(input.SecurityGroups)
}
```

The file ruleexists.rego should exist in the same directory (container) as the test files.
