# Prancer Platform documentation site

Welcome to the **Prancer** cloud security platform documentation!

**Prancer** is a pre-deployment and post-deployment multi-cloud security platform for your Infrastructure as Code (IaC) security and continuous compliance requirements in the cloud.

**Prancer** integrates with your developer's pipeline to ensure the secure and quality code will reach the cloud. It prevents any security misconfiguration from being applied to the cloud via the IaC pipeline security validation gates. In case of finding any problem, Prancer can file a PR on behalf of the user to remediate the issue in the code.

Moreover, **Prancer** validates your cloud resources based on available compliance frameworks and custom policy files. It scans the cloud environment continuously to find security misconfigurations. It alerts and reports on problems and provides an easy way to auto remediate the problems.
