# Prancer Security Platform Docs

Welcome to the **Prancer** cloud security platform documentation!

**Prancer** is an end-to-end cloud security platform that promotes Shift Left strategies. Prancer provides tools for the pre-deployment and post-deployment multi-cloud validation at scale for your Infrastructure as Code (IaC) security and continuous compliance requirements in the cloud. Also, It provides Penetration as Code (PAC) Framework.
 > Note: PAC is not covered in this documentation.

For the IaC Static Code Analysis (SCA) part, **Prancer** integrates with your DevOps pipeline to ensure that secure and quality code will reach the cloud. It prevents any security misconfiguration from being applied to the cloud via the IaC pipeline security validation gates. In case of finding any problem, Prancer can file a PR on behalf of the user to remediate the issue in the code.

Moreover, **Prancer** validates your cloud resources based on available compliance frameworks and custom policy files. It scans the cloud environment continuously to find security misconfigurations. It alerts and reports on problems and provides an easy way to auto remediate them.
